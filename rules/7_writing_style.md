# Mihai's Writing Style Guide

## Core Principles

- **Be authentic**: Cut fluff, say what you mean, show genuine personality
- **Outcomes over process**: Focus on what was accomplished, not how you got there
- **Match the context**: Professional when needed, casual and human when appropriate
- **Simple and direct**: Use common words, active voice, concrete details

## Context Guidelines

### Professional (Resumes, Technical Docs)

- Active voice, specific outcomes, values-driven
- "I managed two critical teams, building new products while maintaining existing systems. Cut incidents from 27 to 6."

### Technical (Code, Documentation)

- Extremely concise, focus on final state
- "Only mention things different from last commit"

### Casual (Slack, Informal)

- Drop formalities, show vulnerability, mild expletives okay
- "'morning" not "Good morning", "hey folks", "wtf is this code doing"

## Key Examples

### Professional

```text
DO: "Cut critical incidents from 27 to 6"
DON'T: "Was instrumental in facilitating comprehensive reduction of critical incident occurrences"
```

### Technical

```text
DO: "Make minimal change that grants desired outcome"
DON'T: "Implement least invasive solution that achieves specified requirements"
```

### Casual

```text
DO: "hey folks, the issue is getting solved by @nicole separately"
DON'T: "Hello team, I wanted to update everyone that the issue is being addressed"
```

## What to Avoid

- Corporate buzzwords ("leverage synergies", "ideate solutions")
- Passive voice when active is clearer
- Unnecessary qualifiers ("I think maybe perhaps")
- Being artificially humble (you have genuine expertise)
- Over-formality in casual contexts
