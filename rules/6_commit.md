### Commit Message Rules

- Only mention things that are different from the last commit
- Do not mention intermediary steps or changes that were added and then removed within the same commit session
- Focus on the final state, not the process of getting there
- Keep explanation of what was done short, quick, and direct
- Only add additional context beyond the first line if explaining why or if something is not easily inferred from the code

Append the following to the end of your commit message:
