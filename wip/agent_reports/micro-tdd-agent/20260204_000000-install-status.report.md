**Agent**: micro-tdd-agent  
**Date**: 2026-02-04  
**Task**: Add status summary to install.sh

## Implementation

### Change Description
Added basic status output at the end of `install.sh` to show configuration summary.

### Files Modified
- `install.sh`

### Changes Made
Added 3 lines at the end of the script:
```bash
echo ""
echo "✅ Configuration complete!"
echo "Configured 8 symlinks: scripts, rules, commands, skills, agents (Claude + OpenCode)"
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing ✅
Since this slice uses manual testing only, no automated test files were created.

**Test Result**: Script runs successfully and produces the expected output:
```
✅ Configuration complete!
Configured 8 symlinks: scripts, rules, commands, skills, agents (Claude + OpenCode)
```

### Verification Steps
1. Ran `./install.sh` - script completes successfully
2. Verified output shows clear status summary
3. All 8 symlinks are properly configured

## Quality Standards

✅ **No redundant comments** - Added clean output without comments  
✅ **Minimal change** - Only 3 lines added  
✅ **User-friendly output** - Clear, concise status message with checkmark  
✅ **Follows existing patterns** - Uses same echo style as rest of script

## Status

**✅ SUCCESS**

The implementation adds a clear status summary that shows:
- Visual confirmation (✅ checkmark)
- Total symlink count (8)
- What was configured (scripts, rules, commands, skills, agents for Claude + OpenCode)

All quality standards met. Manual testing confirms the output is user-friendly and informative.
